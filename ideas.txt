Length      - Length of line
Orthogonal  - ?
Every icon before must...
Every icon after must...
The previous icon must...
The next icon must...



Instead of icons we have objects that disappear after a valid pass
An invalid pass means no movement
Tokens (shrink)


Circle, square, diamond, etc
Only valid moves go forward, a single move over all icons wins
Only valid moves go forward, moves remove icons, removing all icons wins
Any possible move goes forward, valid moves remove icons, removing all icons wins
Mimics the attempted moves of others, does not push
Mimics the attempted moves of others, does push


Objects
Wall:       Must not be in path
Water:      Must not be first or final path point

For consistency, icons work best when all seen from the same perspective (above)
Icons do not have memory
Icons disappear if successfully traversed

Icons (fade)

Circle
Square

Copy        Clover                      Take on the requirement of the next requirement in the path (4 leaves, suggests magic)



Consecutive                                 Must not be separated by other icons on a path


Line

Symmetric   ?                               Must be crossed by a symmetrical path (data: reflection (H, V, R, P?, N?))
Direction   Paw print   Triangle            Must be exited in the indicated direction

Lily pad

Sun, Moon, Star (4 spikes, ring?)
Spiderweb, Snowflake
Circle, Square, Diamond (shape)
Urchin, Clam, Crab
Starfish, Spikes, Turtle, Ladybug, Spider, Centipede, Scorpion, Bee, Wasp, Fruit (sliced?), Gem (natural crystal? cut?)

Start a line on a type to require its satisfaction
Place many requirements over chasm with few rest points (perhaps 2)



            Path must only contain members of group number
            Path must cross half of all icons
            Path must separate icon colors
            Path must be a straight line
            Path must be a rectangle
            Path must have n turns
            Path must have a certain length
            Path must have a 'winding number' of zero


The main problem with off-path requirements is that they must be satisfied on every move, meaning they must all disappear on the first move
They are thematically inconsistent with the on-path lines that can be removed over a series of turns

Path icon knows about self (stone)

Path icon knows about shape of path (leaf)
Path icon knows about all icons? ()

Non-path icon knows about all icons? (wall, satisfied when NOT on path)
Icon knows about past states? X

Non-path icons? Surround, separate, etc., that prevent a movement and disappear on completion?

Rules

Advancing while consuming icons destroys a snap
Advancing without consuming any icons repositions a snap
To win a level, all icons must be consumed and snaps removed


Add a scale to icons and snaps
On advance, begin downscale toward zero and disable



Advance
Advance and consume?
Advance and evaporate?





Random level thoughts/records

Starting on a requirement forces completion of requirement

Last requirements placed in nooks bordered by wall on three sides forces completion of multiple paths
Placing a sequence of icons between walls over water forces the simultaneous completion of those icons
    Horizontal + Vertical Symmetry = straight line requirement
    n Pair icons = sequence length of 2n
All of one type over water, rest over land
Easy route to eliminate a type, but not enough remaining to satisfy pairs

Palindrome + Pair + Cover

Offer an easy palindrome, but hide the other palindrome next to an unavoidable icon


Cover

Pair

Order

Separate

Palindrome

Symmetry

Together


Exclude     Must not be in the same path as an Exclude of a different group
Offset      Cover that must be satisfied at a distance
Line        Every cell up to the next wall or level edge must be covered
Fill        Every cell on the level must have a path through it
Final       When this path completes, there must be no remaining icons
Alone       There must be no other icons on the path
Uncovered   Must not be covered, disappears after 1 turn 
Turn        Must be crossed on the nth turn
Count       Must be n icons on line
Rotate      Line must pass through cell in clockwise or counterclockwise rotation
Half        Half of all icons must be on line
Isolate     All icons not on the line must be alone
First       Must be crossed first in a path
Last        Must be crossed last in a path
Equal       Must be the same number of Equals of each color on the path
Group       Must have Groups of only one color on the path
Even        Must have an even number of clams in the path (clamshells, paired)
            Path must only contain members of group number
            Path must be a square/rectangle
            Path must have n turns
            Path must have a certain length
            Path must have a 'winding number' of zero

Selection

Path - Disappears when on path
Encirclement - Disappears when encircled by path
Global - Always disappears on first move

With a small number of possible experiments, requirements are indistinguishable from each other





Bad ideas

Player collects things after going over them
Order (can't go over higher orders while lesser orders are present globally)
Different Snap types (straight line only, crossover)
Brown blocks that can be pushed (mobile on ground, fixed in water)
Gray snaps that mimic player
